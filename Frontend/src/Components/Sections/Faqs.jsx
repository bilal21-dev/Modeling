            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Any reputable or successful modeling agency would never charge representation or website fees. The only necessary costs that a model could face in the developmental stages of their career is for portfolio building event that fee is waived off if the model is really passionate. Any model who is successful through our onboarding process will receive their developmental programme in house, for free. Portfolio building is guided by the agency with our recommended photographers or sourced by the model. The model will pay the photographer directly and the agency does not make any financial gain from this.

            <p className="text-gray-600">
              The short answer is no. Every models journey is different, some work straight away, others it takes a little longer and some simply do not work. We will try our hardest to create opportunities and open up doors for our talent but the final decision lies with the client and therefore no genuine agency can guarantee work. We do however receive many briefs so as long as your portfolio is kept up to date with fresh imagery, our clients can see you. As a top modeling agency in Lahore for Females, We work on full transparency and make no false promises.
